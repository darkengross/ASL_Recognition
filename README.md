# ASL_Recognition

In this End-To=End ASL Recognition project, you will use keras and tenserflow to build a machine learning model.

we will train our data on multiple models. And we will look and compare the accuracy on the respective models. The models we will be using are:
- Logistic Regtression
- SVM
- Decision Trees
- Na√Øve Bees
- Random Forests
- KNN

- CNN (Deep Learning Implemented using tenserflow) 

You will visualize the images and analyze the data, process the data for the modeling phase, compile, train, and CNN on the image dataset, and visualize the wrong predictions. You will use the wrong predictions to improve the model performance.
